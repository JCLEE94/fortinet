## Security Measures Applied

### Enhanced Security Policy
- Updated `.safety-policy.yml` with stricter security standards
- Configured to fail on critical, high, and medium severity vulnerabilities
- Disabled vulnerability error continuation for immediate failure

### Package Management Security
- Pinned package versions to prevent regression to vulnerable versions
- Removed unnecessary packages (python-jose, ecdsa) to reduce attack surface
- Replaced vulnerable libraries with more secure alternatives
- Updated requirements.txt with security-focused version constraints

### Dependency Cleanup
- **Removed**: pypdf2, python-jose, ecdsa (vulnerable packages)
- **Upgraded**: pypdf, anyio, pyjwt, flask-caching, fastapi, python-multipart
- **System Updates**: pip, mako, future

## Verification Results

### Security Scan Results
