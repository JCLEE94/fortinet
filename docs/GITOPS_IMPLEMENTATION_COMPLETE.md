## 🔄 GitOps Workflow

### Automated Pipeline Flow
1. **Code Push** → GitHub repository (master branch)
2. **GitHub Actions** → Triggers automated pipeline
3. **Test Stage** → Runs pytest and code quality checks
4. **Build Stage** → Creates Docker image and pushes to Harbor Registry
5. **Helm Deploy** → Packages Helm chart and pushes to ChartMuseum
6. **ArgoCD Sync** → Automatically detects changes and deploys
7. **Verification** → Health checks confirm successful deployment
8. **Notification** → Pipeline status reported

### Manual Deployment Options
```bash
# Complete GitOps setup (one-time)
./scripts/gitops/setup-complete-gitops.sh

# Individual components
./scripts/gitops/setup-github-secrets.sh
./scripts/gitops/setup-k8s-resources.sh  
./scripts/gitops/apply-argocd-app.sh
./scripts/gitops/verify-deployment.sh
```

## 🧪 Testing the Pipeline

### 1. Code Change & Push
```bash
# Make any code change
echo "# GitOps test $(date)" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: test GitOps pipeline"
git push origin master
```

### 2. Monitor Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/JCLEE94/fortinet/actions
